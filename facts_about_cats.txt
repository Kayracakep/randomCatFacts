Grown cats have 30 teeth. Kittens have about 26 temporary teeth, which they lose when they are about 6 months old.
An adult lion's roar can be heard up to five miles (eight kilometers) away.
According to Hebrew legend, Noah prayed to God for help protecting all the food he stored on the ark from being eaten by rats. In reply, God made the lion sneeze, and out popped a cat.
